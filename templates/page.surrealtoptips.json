Before adding any new succulents to your collection, thoroughly check them for signs of pests. It's also a good idea to quarantine new plants for a couple of weeks to ensure they are pest-free. Regular monitoring of your succulents is essential; inspect them frequently for any unusual signs such as discolouration, webbing, or stunted growth.</p><p>Proper watering practices play a crucial role in pest prevention. Overwatering can lead to soggy soil, which attracts pests. Always allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Ensuring good air circulation around your succulents also helps to keep pests at bay by preventing moisture buildup on leaves and stems.</p><p>Maintaining cleanliness is another preventive measure. Use clean tools when handling your plants to avoid transferring pests. Additionally, keeping the area around your succulents clean and free of debris can prevent pests from finding a comfortable habitat. For added protection, neem oil can be applied periodically as a natural deterrent against many common pests.</p><p>Using biological controls, such as introducing natural predators like ladybugs, can help keep pest populations in check. Moreover, it's important to prune any dead or diseased parts of the plant promptly, as they can attract pests. Ensuring that your succulents have adequate space to grow will also reduce the likelihood of pests spreading rapidly between plants.</p><p>By following these preventive measures, you can significantly reduce the chances of pests invading your succulent collection. Consistent care and vigilance are key to maintaining a healthy, pest-free environment for your plants.</p>",

Place it in a warm, bright area but out of direct sunlight, preferably in a controlled environment between 18-22°C. Germination can take several weeks to months, so consistent care and monitoring are key.</p>",

You can also create your own mix by combining regular potting soil with coarse sand or perlite to enhance drainage. The well-draining soil ensures the cuttings establish roots without sitting in overly moist conditions.</p><p>Once the plants are established, you can consider repotting into a more fertile soil to speed up growing rates.</p>",
